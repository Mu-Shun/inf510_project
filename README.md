# MLB Athletic Database and Data Analyzing

This project requires the following packages:

pandas, numpy, sqlite, requests and beautifulsoup

Run the Mu-Shun_Lee_hw5.py to produce an MLB.db. The database will contain the data from 1980 to 2019. Then open the jupyter notebook-Project_Analysis and run in all to see the result. I would use a jupyter notebook to present the result due to it is more readable, also some of the information below is covered in the notebook. The database first collects the top 100 ERA/AVG pitchers and players from 1980 till 2019. Secondly, enter into their URL and grab their annual data of batting/pitching/fielding based on each player. (So there will be thousands of URLs to grab to get their information) Last but not least, grab their data through the external API.
